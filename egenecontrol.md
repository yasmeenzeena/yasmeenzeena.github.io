# L16-20 Gene regulation in eukaryotes

## Chromatin

+ H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 -> histone proteins
+ positively charged (rich in basic aa e.g. lysine and arginine, 20 to 24% of sequence) so negative phosphates of DNA attach
+ neutralise DNA so allows tighter packing
+ histones interact mainly with the minor groove of DNA -> H bond to oxygen and OH of AT regions and backbone
+ have a stem loop structure at the ends to avoid degradation (instead of poly A tail)
+ in S phase when histones are needed (dna replication) stem loop is stabilised, in rest of the cycle it is unwound to degrade the histones
+ example of stability control
+ highly conserved across evolution since necessary to eukaryotic gene regulation

**nucleosome** = unit of chromatin, equal to DNA of 200bp wrapping around a histone complex of: 2 molecules of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. one molecule of H1 sits above the nucleosome and provides tighter packing. -> H1 present in half the amount of the other four. Role is to compact DNA and produce another level of regulation between euchromatin and heterochromatin. More specifically, two H2A-H2B dimers and one H3-H4 tetramer. Histone 2AZ variant replaced H2A in some nucleosomes —> suggested that proximity between H2AZ containing nucleosome and the transcription start site is an indication of gene expression i.e. if H2AZ close to TSS the gene has a higher expression level! Nucleosome displaced from TSS to being transcription, and blocks the TSS in inactive genes. So H2AZ may destabilise the nucleosome and also may recruit RNA polymerase II.
> R. Bargaje 2012 “Proximity of H2A.Z containing nucleosome to the transcription start site influences gene expression levels in the mammalian liver and brain”

In a partial digest use enzymes that only cut the lengths of DNA between the nucleosomes (i.e. the exposed DNA), showing them to be about 200bp long -> “*beads on a string*” model [halt DNA digest before all the dna is digested to nucleotides, hence partial]

Beads on a strong are not the tightest form possible. H1, on the nucleosome, allows tighter packing than this into a 30nm fibre -> could either be a single helix (one start model, solenoid structure) or a helical ribbon (two start model, made via zig zagging the DNA.)

(histone octamer: x2 H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and 146bp of DNA wrapped around the histones to shorted in, plus 54bp that serve as a “linker” to link  nucleosomes together -> histone H1 associated with nucleosome, but once linker is digested histone H1 is released so histone H1 does further packing of the beads on a string into a 30nm fibre)

After 30nm fibre -> looped to get a 300nm structure, heterochromatin [euchromatin goes into a the heterochromatin structure in mitosis and meiosis since chromosomes must go to the right place, easier to segregate if they’re tightly packed]

## Structure & expression of eukaryotic genes

Typical eukaryotic gene: box is transcribed into RNA after the initiation site, first base transcription is +1,

RNA polymerase III = tRNA transcription and other RNA level molecules, don't need to be converted into protein<br/>
RNA polymerase II = mRNA from protein coding genes<br/>
RNA polymerase I = ribosomal RNAs<br/>

Function was found by using alpha amanitin to inhibit RNA polymerases -> II inhibited first, so mRNA production lost, then III knocked out to lose transcription of tRNA and others.

### RNA polymerase II:

Promoter = TATA box at -30 upstream, found in most eukaryotic genes, defines the start site (if you move TATA you move start site, TATA box defines start site 30 base pairs downstream from it’s location) & transcription factor binding sites e.g. SP1 -> delete TTA box to stop transcription to show that it’s an initiation factor.

TATA box = non-coding DNA sequence (cis-regulatory element)

TATA box recognised by TFIID and TFIIA “recognition event” —> (transcription factor 2 stands for RNA polymerase 2)
then TF2B also binds —> RNA polymerase 2 recognises and binds to TF2D,A&B —> TF2F associated with RNA polymerase and also binds —> TF2H binds and phosphorylates the polymerase (a kinase), so transcription may begin —> TF2D and A are left on the DNA for the next transcription event

Note: RNA polymerases never recognise DNA sequences, but recognise transcription factors bound to the DNA!

^”*basal transcriptional complex*” slow rate hence “basal” so needs transcription factors

summary: TF2D & A —> TF2B —> RNA polymerase & TF2F —> TF2H —> all dissociate but TF2D&A

#### Enhancer
= interacts with the promoter to increase transcription rate, distance not an issue, can be anywhere on the gene, in any orientation: action is independent of distance, orientation and position. Binding site of a transcription factor.
e.g. SP40 eukaryotic virus has:
+ CAT box (binding site for the RNA transcription factor)
+ SP1 binding site (SP1 = zinc finger transcription factor that binds to GC-rich motifs)  
+ 5000bp so easier to study, has all the eukaryotic transcription control sequences

Enhancer action can open the chromatin to allow the TF2D to bind more easily. How does an enhancer effect the promotor? Idea could be “tracking” - a protein binds the enhancer and then searches downstream until it finds the promoter, or “looping”, where the enhancer and promoter are close together in three-dimensional space.

Note: in humans many promoters contain CpG islands (i.e. cystine residue on the CpG dimer is methylated) -> act as sites of transcription initiation (70% of human genes, all housekeeping ones), usually wont coincide with a TATA box, will allow transcription start over a range of sites (not as focused.) BUT e.g. -globin gene has a TATA box and a CpG island.
> A. Deaton CpG islands and the regulation of transcription 2011

### RNA polymerase I:

Transcribes one gene for ribosomes, which is repeated in tandem in the DNA with spacers in between which are not transcribed. Makes 28S, 18S and 5.8S ribosome units = 45S precursor made then cleaved. No splicing in humans, need constant ribosome expression so don’t need control.

1. upstream binding factor (UBF) binds the rRNA gene promotor -50 upstream
2. SL1 factor allows RNA polymerase 1 recruitment —> transcription occurs

self splicing occurs in protozoa (tetrahymena) not humans -> intron in the primary rRNA transcript splices itself out, no need for protein assembly so can be done in vitro with just ion solutions -> Nobel prize for organic solution self splicing. All splicing info is held within the RNA.  [origin of splicing!]   

### RNA polymerase III:
5S of ribosome and tRNA

5S ribosomal RNA, genes are tandemly repeated in the DNA, has internal promoters —> TF3A and TF3C bind to the site at +50, TF3B binds at the +1 site, RNA polymerase III is recruited. Found by removing the upstream sequence and transcription still occured. Deletion of downstream also continued to allow transcription.

as 5S concentration goes up TF3A starts to bind to the mRNA sequence as well as the DNA sequence -> removes TF3A from DNA so acts as a negative feedback to lower 5S concentration.

### mRNA assembly:

**Addition of 5’ cap**: a methylated guanosine is added to the first transcribed base via a 5’-5’ interaction [i.e. the phosphate on the C5 of the nucleotide is bound to the c5 of the guanosine.] 5 prime to 5 prime bond so different to other phosphodiester bonds. The N7 position is methylated. Post transcriptional modification. Not encoded by DNA, added de novo. Ribosome binds to the 5’cap (guide feature) and initiates translation at the AUG codon. Polio virus doesn’t cap their mRNA -> protein binds to end of the RNA, allows it to be translated, so a cap mimicking protein + polio destroys the capping system of the host so only virus RNA translated.

**Poly A tail**: mRNA cleaved about 20-30bp downstream of the AAUAAA site = poly A site. Poly A site is preserved (we cut after it) and then 200 A residues are added for stability (protects from degradation like a telomere.) GU rich sequence is cleaved.

CPSF factor binds to the AAUAAA region, and CstF binds to the G/U sequence downstream of the poly adenylation site.

![polyA](http://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/Aide-memoire/_UK/poly/polyadenylation.png)

The complexes bind together to fold the mRNA over, exposing the poly A site for cleavage. The sequence with CstF is degraded, whilst the main mRNA sequence with the CPSF has a poly A tail added by poly A polymerase. 3’ ends usually vulnerable to exonuclease function, protected by tail. Not occurring on rRNA or tRNA so good way to select protein coding mRNA by using t affinity chromatography. Histones don’t have poly A tails -> have a stem loop structure instead via base pairing. When histone protein replication occurs (in S phase) stem loop structure is present so histones made from the mRNA, but in other phases the stem loop doesnt form -> no RNA made so no translation as we don’t need -> example of translational control.

> nuclear export of mRNAs: mRNA with bound proteins = messenger ribonucleoprotein; hnRNP C tetramer measures transcript length, Tap-p15 mediates mRNA translocation by associating with FG repeats on nucleoporins in the nuclear envelope. “Nuclear Export of Messenger RNA” 2015 J. Katahira.

**Splicing**: must remove the introns from mRNA (non coding DNA present in the gene and in the primary transcript of mRNA.) Once mRNA leaves the nucleus it must be fully processed i.e. only exons. Exon exit the nucleus, introns stay.

GU —-> intron <—— AG

Thus 5’ splice site = GU, 3’ splice site = AG

5’ splice site is cut, leaving exon 1 and intron&exon2.

Exon 1 could react back to remake the previous structure, as it is held by the splisosome in place, but a lariat is formed by the intron: the 5’-UG reacts with an A residue (branch point) in the intron via a 5’-2’ bond (since the 3’-OH is being used in the DNA backbone.)5’ G cannot now back-react. Once the system has defined the branch point, the next AG  (3’ splice site) is cut to release exon 2.

![splice](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/RNA_splicing_reaction.svg/400px-RNA_splicing_reaction.svg.png)

Guiding molecules: splisosome has *URNAs* (rich in uridine) to catalyse splicing progress.

Exon 1 held in place by the splisosome organelle so cannot diffuse away. [Autoimmune disease SLE -> antibodies made against their own proteins to inhibit splicing. Used to study splicing reaction.] SM proteins are associated with URNAs.

U1 binds to the 5’ splice site at GU, and U2 binds to the A residue in the intron, aka the branch point. U5 binds to exon 1. U4/6 replaces U1 at the UG 5’ splice site, resulting in U6 and U2 interaction -> this bends the DNA and allows the lariat to form. Now the 5’ splice site can be cut —-> exon 1 released, lariat and exon two remain —> exon 2 released by 3’ splicing —-> intron with associate proteins is free

All proteins left on the lariate to leave the RNA “clean” for translation.

### Intron evolution:
+ might have started with self splicing mechanisms that then become more complex and the splisosome grew up around it
+ spliceosomal introns are absent in prokaryotes
+ EARLY INTRON MODEL:
1. irons found in modern species are still ancient in origin -> conserved
2. conservation of splisosome across eukaryotes suggests complex spliceosome in the ancestor of all eukaryotes
3. suggestion that introns were already numerous in early eukaryotes and current species have experienced intron loss since then
4. intron loss from recombination of the DNA and the reverse transcript of the spliced mRNA
5. In this model, introns were then lost from prokaryotic genomes
+ LATE INTRON MODEL:
1. the phylogenetic restriction of spliceosomal introns to eukaryotes reflects their more recent insertion into originally 2. intronless genes after the divergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes [not in prokaryotes so much have evolved after the split]
3. introns evolved from type II bacterial introns in relatively early eukaryotes

### Gene regulation in eukaryotes

Are all proteins made: Use Western Blotting to compare protein production in different tissues -> shows that some proteins are only translated in some tissues, hence protein control must be tissue specific.

Are all mRNAS made: Use northern blotting [RNA electrophoresis then probe the membrane] or microarrays to see if all mRNA of protein coding is made in each tissue type or not. Answer: no! Use a microarray with all genes and hybridise them with labelled mRNA -> shows that not all genes make mRNA in every tissue, so we have transcriptional control.  Northern blotting shows mRNA differences in one gene between two tissues whereas microarrays are wider.

Transcriptional control is the main control -> all DNA is present in every cell but only some mRNAs are made, hence transcription is regulated (use Northern blotting to show this.)

Is all DNA present in all tissues: DNA is *usually* present in all cells, although:

+ **DNA loss**: doesn’t occur since chromosomes look the same in all cells, and if DNA loss would occur further differentiation would be impossible -> disproven by *totipotency* = take an enucleated egg cell and put in a differentiated nucleus = adult frog made. + Dolly the sheep.  If you remove lens cells in an amphibian the iris cells differentiate into lens cells = *transdifferentiation*; go back into stem cells then divide into lens cells
1. RBC lose their nucleus to give more room for O2 carrying haemoglobin, long lived globin mRNAs are laid down in the cell for global creation
+ **DNA amplification**: i.e. genes needed in a tissue are specifically amplified so make many copies. Molecular biology experiment: Southern blotting and probes show that genes in different tissues have the same banding pattern so no DNA loss and no amplification since should get different bands.
1. Drosophila: nurse cells surrounding the eggs add egg shell proteins (chorion.) Chorion genes are amplified in the nurse cells (shows more intense bands) because they need to be made very quickly.  
2. Cancer: Genomic DNA copy number aberrations are frequent in solid tumors and are expected to contribute to tumor evolution by copy number-induced alterations in gene expression. 
+ **DNA rearrangement**: promotor or enhancer brought need the needed genes, so in southern blotting we should get different bands since enzymes would cut in different places -> banding pattern disproves rearrangement
1. Rearrangement of DNA in immunoglobulin genes -> rearrangement of the light chain results in linkage of variable V and joining J region (removed DNA in between) so gene is switched on + gives specificity depending on which V andJ are joined

Therefore = **DNA expression is regulated! Differential expression = gene regulation!**

Is control at transcription or after? mRNA is made only from active genes: this is shown through experiments that prove that non active mRNA is not made and quickly degraded:

1. Inactive genes might be made: make a Northern blot targeted to nuclear mRNA (homogenise nucleus to get snapshot) which would show if inactive genes are transcribed-> no evidence of this, only get active genes made into mRNA and pre spliced sequences. Steady state measure so cannot prove transcriptional control only support it.  

2. Inactive genes might get degraded quickly: measure actual rates of gene transcription by pulse labelling:

3. *pulse labelling* -> add in radioactive UTPs and see what type of mRNA is synthesised (only works for RNA with a high synthesis level since radioactivity can only briefly be pulsed. Method is very insensitive, only works about about 20 genes that are highly synthesised.)

4. *nuclear run on assay* -> to get a higher efficiency with the pulse labelling method remove the cytoplasm and add radioactive UTP directly to the nucleus so only radioactive nucleotides are available (less dilute)
remove cytoplasm = RNA polymerases stall on the gene
add radioactive nucleotides
polymerases start again, transcription occurs
run a “nuclear run off” assay to see what mRNA is made [i.e. basically northern blotting, hybridise and see if the mRNA is present in two different tissue types, for e.g. ]
hybridise the extracted RNA to gene specific probes on a blot

5. Salivary glands of Drosophila has polytene chromosome / giant chromosome [multiple rounds of replication produce many sister chromatids which stay fused together] due to global DNA amplification (unknown why this occurs.) Treat with steroid hormone and parts of the chromosome puff outwards (if you heat different parts puff outwards) -> puffs represent sites of transcription, puffing caused by new transcription -> prove this by giving steroid hormones and radioactive UTP to make radio-labelled RNA -> hydrides radioactive RNA back to the chromosomes = see where it was transcribed from, see that the mRNA hybridises with the puffs. If the puff disappears so does the RNA hybridisation site since they are one and the same. Visualisation of transcriptional control!

^ all proves that control is at transcription. Most expensive step of expression is translation so best to have transcriptional control to minimise lost ATP.

### POST TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL: specific cases

**Precursor-RNA control**: RNA processing control. In Drosphila “incorrect” splicing to not remove introns can mark the presursor-mRNA for destruction; p element transposase gene controlled by this discard, only processed and made into protein in germline cells.

**Alternate splicing in eukaryotes** -> RNA processing control = different exon arrangement from one gene, can splice the exon differently e.g. can make either calcitonin in the thyriod or CGPR in the brain from the same gene. Gene has two poly A tail sites so that either transcript will still have a poly A tail. Calcitonin = exons 1-4, CGPR = exons 1-3 and 5&6.

e.g. antibodies are released from the cell by alternate splicing —> usually antibodies made with a hydrophobic tail (to sit in the membrane) but when under attack splicing pattern is changed to remove this exon from the immunoglobulin primary transcript’s C terminus, so that the antibodies can be released from the cell. So stage 1: membrane bound antibodies made in early immune response, stage 2: antigens binds, stimulates cells with correct antibody to proliferate, change in splicing to allow secreted antibodies.

e.g. troponin always made in muscles, but spliced alternatively in different muscles

**RNA stability** —> casein, protein in milk -> prolactin hormone stimulates the gene and stabilises the mRNA of casein.  

e.g. histone production, stabilised by the stem loop structure rather than poly A tail, occurs during S phase when histone production is needed, stem loop not made outside of S phase.

e.g. mRNA of globin gene kept stable in enucleated RBCs. Globin mRNA half-lives vary from 10 to 24 hours. thalassemia = disease caused by mutation of DNA than inhibits globin mRNA transcription/processing e.g. blocks polyadenylation.

e.g. iron-responsive element stabilised by iron regulatory proteins binding the transferrin receptor mRNA or the DMT1 mRNA.
