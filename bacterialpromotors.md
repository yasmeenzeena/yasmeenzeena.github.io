### L8: Bacterial gene control

Aims of this lecture:
+ The bacterial operon:
    1. Positive and negative regulation of the lactose operon
    2. Regulation of the tryptophan operon by a repressor protein and by
the process of attenuation.
    3. Two-component regulatory systems – phosphate concentration
and gene regulation.
    4. Quorum sensing and the lux operon – you will PROBABLY not find
this information in most textbooks. The notes given should suffice.
    5. The ribosomal and transfer RNA operons of E. coli

## Positive and negative regulation of the lactose operon

Housekeeping proteins are always present in the cell in a constant concentration, but
other proteins are linked to nutrient amounts in the environment.

Genes coding for proteins involved in same metabolic pathway are clustered into an
OPERON! Therefore a cluster of genes can make one long mRNA which is later split up
into the individual proteins its codes for "polycistronic mRNA."
![polycistronic](http://bio1510.biology.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/coupled-transcription-translation.jpg)
The polycistronic mRNA will have a number of AUGs (methoinine = start codon) and
UGAs (stop codon) to indicate where each polypeptide begins and ends in the RNA.
When the mRNA is being translated the ribosome will bind to AUG, translate til UGA and
unbind. This will occur for each polypeptide in the RNA sequence.

Genes are only transcribed when needed!
>inducible operons = must be turned on
>repressible operons = must be turned off
