### L8: Bacterial gene control

Aims of this lecture:
+ The bacterial operon:
    1. Positive and negative regulation of the lactose operon
    2. Regulation of the tryptophan operon by a repressor protein and by
the process of attenuation.
    3. Two-component regulatory systems – phosphate concentration
and gene regulation.
    4. Quorum sensing and the lux operon – you will PROBABLY not find
this information in most textbooks. The notes given should suffice.
    5. The ribosomal and transfer RNA operons of E. coli
