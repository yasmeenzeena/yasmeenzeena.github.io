### L7&8: Gene regulation in bacteria

Aims of these lectures:
1. The role of RNA polymerase and the transcription of an RNA molecule from
a DNA template. Termination of transcription in the bacterium E.coli. Both
rho independent and rho dependent termination of transcription will be
described.
2. The bacterial operon:
    1. Positive and negative regulation of the lactose operon
    2. Regulation of the tryptophan operon by a repressor protein and by
the process of attenuation.
    3. Two-component regulatory systems – phosphate concentration
and gene regulation.
    4. Quorum sensing and the lux operon – you will PROBABLY not find
this information in most textbooks. The notes given should suffice.
    5. The ribosomal and transfer RNA operons of E. coli

## TRANSCRIPTION

Most transcriptional information we have is based off of the E. coli model. Transcription in
bacteria must be done swiftly. This is achieved by running transcription and translation
simultaneously: there is no nuclear membrane so mRNA and protein will form at the same time. In
eukaryotes the compartmentalisation of the cell by a nuclear membrane stops translation
occurring inside the nucleus.

+ no post transcription modification in bacteria means no splicing, no poly A tail addition or intron removal (no introns at all.)
Bacteria have short life so processes like these must be fast. The moment RNA is transcribed protein synthesis needs to begin as well.

>mRNA = messanger, directs the protein synthesis by carrying the genetic code<br/>
>tRNA = transfer, carries the amino acid in protein synthesis<br/>
>rRNA = structural component of the ribosome<br/>

**Role of RNA polymerase:** turns DNA into RNA by catalysing the phosphodiester bond
between the 5-phosphate and the 3-OH group on the ribose sugar. Pyrophosphate is a
biproduct (PiPi, gamma and beta phosphates are released from the nucleotide when the
backbone is formed as only the alpha Pi is kept.) Uracil instead of thymine is used (H
rather than a methyl, so uracil is simpler.)

RNA polymerase moves along the DNA from 3'->5', synthesising the new RNA strand in
the 5'->3' direction.

RNA synthesis was proved using Sanger sequencing: if the 3' OH is removed then mRNA
synthesis stops, so the phosphodiester bond must be made using the 3' OH.

## RNA Polymerase Subunits
+ 2 indentical alpha units --> core
+ beta unit --> core
+ beta prime unit --> core
    + these all make up the holoenzyme
+ sigma factor

These were first visualised by cellulose acetate chromatography, a gel filtration precursor that also separates by size.

RNA polymerase MUST: 1. recognise the binding site (as RNA polymerase binds
nucleotides together without a primer this is key!) 2. catalyse the phosphodiester
formation between the nucleotides 3. recognise the end of the gene.
Binding: sigma subunit recognises and binds to the promoter sequence at the beginning
of the gene (upsteam, - value.)

Binding: sigma subunit recognises and binds to the promoter sequence at the beginning

+1 = first base to be transcribed upstream = to the LHS,
negative numbers (promoter and regulation area)<br/>
downstream = to the RHS, rest of the gene<br/>

sigma 70 means that the sigma unit Mr = 70000

The sigma 70 subunit recognises the -35 and the -10 upstream regions of DNA: these
make up the promoter. -35 is the recognition site, with a complimentary DNA sequence
to sigma so it can hybridise. -10 region helps the RNA polymerase orient itself and
stabilises the a2, b and b' subunits around the DNA strand. -10 region is AT rich so easily
unwinds. Thus, once -35 binding occurs other subunits may also bind.

Most E. coli promoters have a consensus sequence whereby the sigma factor binding
sites are the same! -35 has a TTGACAT sequence, and ~17 bp towards the +1 start site
the -10 region has a sequence of TATAAT. -35 and -10 regions are close by so that the
DNA doesn't twist around the protein by stays linearised.
