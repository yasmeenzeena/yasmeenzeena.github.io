## Human Genome

This can be split up into the **nuclear genome** and the **mitochondrial genome.**
Mitochondrial genome is inherited purely from the maternal line and there is no
recombination. Of the 37 genes it encodes 22 are tRNA genes, 13 are for
enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (main role of mitochondria =
OxPhos) and 2 make rRNA. Mitochondrial genomes are small but there are
many mitochondrial per cell, so their genome can account for up to 0.5% of
the cell's DNA!

+ nuclear genome = 25,000 genes; mitochondrial genome = 37 genes; 22 tRNA,
2 rRNA, 13 for enzymes in OxPhos. </br>

#### Structure of the Mitochondrial Genome

Circular! Double stranded: one heavy & one light strand. Heavy is G-rich so
has more double ring structures (purines), light is C rich so has more single
ring structures (pyrimidines.)

Neither strand has any overlapping genes! There are also no introns (bacterial
descendant.) No introns => whole strand is transcribed as one unit and then
cleaved into individual mRNAs. No need for multiple promoters but all genes
are expressed together.

Heavy: 28 genes encoded, G rich, purines
Light: 9 genes encoded, C rich, pyrimidine

a tiny section of the mitochondria DNA forms a *"D loop"*, where it actually
is triple stranded DNA. A section of complimentary DNA comes in and replaces
the heavy strand and hydrogen bonds to the light strand for a little while.
Replication of the mitochondrial DNA starts in either direction at the D loop.
Large parts are highly variable and the region has proven to be useful for the
study of the evolutionary history of vertebrates

### Nuclear Genome Structure

Chromosomes are numbered by size (1 is the largest etc.) They have a "p"
strand (petite) and a "q" strand (the longer one.) 23 chromosomes are made
from 22 autosomes (i.e. somatic) and one sex chromosome.

Only 1.5% of the genome codes for human proteins! LINES&SINES take up
anywhere from 30% to almost 50%, and introns another 30%. Thus duplications
and repeats account for most of the genome.

### Gene Regulation

DNA is arranged intron->exon->intron->exon. Before and after the exon (i.e.
the gene) is a flanking region. The 5" flanking region contains the promoter
(binds RNA polymerase) and the enhancer&regulatory sequences if applicable
(binds additional proteins to stabilise RNA polymerase complex.) It is not
transcribed nor translated.

The introns are spliced out of mRNA by spliceosome complexes during posttranscription
and a polyA tail is added (exons are re-ligated.) A methyl cap is
added to the polyA tail. This process is called "splicing" in eukaryotes.

Proteins with much larger gene sizes have a higher risk of mutation as it takes
longer for the transcription/translation machinery to work. E.g. the longest
human gene is 2600kb, Dystrophin (16h to transcribe.) Duchenne muscular
dystrophy occurs when mistakes are made in this gene.

About 10% of the genome codes for RNAs rather than proteins: mRNa, rRNA,
tRNA, microRNA (regulation roles), sn and snoRNA (small nuclear & small
nucleolar.)

### Gene Families
Gene duplication and subsequent mutation of the duplicates can result in the
formation of a "gene family." E.g. haemoglobin genes: genes for the alpha
globular protein subunits sit on chromosome 16 and there are three types,
coding for embryo, fetus and adult versions (so 3 duplicates were made and
mutated.) genes for the beta globular protein subunits occur on chromosome
11, and also feature embryo, fetus and adult versions. Genes are arranged in
developmental order, although we are unsure why. Duplication = change to
optimise each duplicate for different life stages through mutation (evolution)!

e.g. Histone gene family: H1, H2A, H2B, H3 & H4. Histones are proteins
around which DNA is wrapped during replication. The DNA-histone complex =
"nucleosome". This ensures fast and correct DNA packaging. Histone genes are
arranged into 11 clusters with over 60 actual genes distributed over 7
chromosomes. Each histone gene encodes an identical protein -> there are 60
because they are needed quickly and in great numbers in DNA replication, so
multiple copies = multiple proteins made at once. Histone genes have no
introns which removes the need for splicing, speeding up the process.

Gene families can be arranged:
1. on different chromosomes (histones)
2. on the same chromosome (haemoglobin subunits)

### Pseudogenes

Gene sequences which cannot code for protein: non-processed pseudogenes
are genes that acquired mutations over time becoming non-functional.
Processed pseudogenes are genes that have lost their function after being
moved around the genome by **retrotransposition**. Processed pseudogenes can also arise via **cell invasion of reverse transcriptase**: some DNA
sequences have been observed to have polyA tails and a lack of introns,
suggesting that they arose from mRNA which reverse transcriptase had turned
back into DNA and reinserted into the chromosome (i.e. *transposons that copy
and paste their genetic information rather than cut and paste it.*) There are not
transcribed into mRNA as their promoter is missing. Processed pseudogenes
are usually found on a different chromosome to their functional gene
counterpart.

+ non processed = arose by duplication and mutation of the gene
+ processed = retrotransposon / reverse transcriptase copy & pasted

### Transposon
DNA sequence with ability to move around in the genome = **“jumping genes”** an
independent entity residing within the genome, encodes all the enzyme needed
for its own transposition = **selfish element**. Transposons are sometimes viewed
as selfish DNA, which is defined as sequences that propagate themselves
within a genome without contributing to the development and functioning of
the organism.

Most of the transposons in the human genome are **nonfunctional**; very few are
currently active. One interesting feature is that some currently functional
genes originated as transposons and evolved into their present condition after
losing the ability to transpose. At least 50 genes appear to have originated in
this manner.

TEs effectively act as **intracellular parasites** and, like other parasites, may need
to strike an evolutionary balance between their own proliferation and the
detrimental effects on the "host" organism...Transposons are restricted to
moving themselves, and sometimes additional sequences, to new sites
elsewhere within the same genome.

Transposons are responsible for the high level of repetition within human
DNA (almost 50% of the genome is repeats) as their mechanism relies on
copy pasting themselves, i.e. a section of DNA, back into the genome many
times.

Class I = **retrotranspons**, code for reverse transcriptase; DNA -> RNA ->
back to DNA, which is inserted at a different point in the genome. The reverse
transcriptase used is often coded for by the transposon gene itself. Confined to
eukaryotes. *[Recent phylogenetic evidence suggests that retroviruses as a
class are simply retrotransposons that have acquired envelope proteins, the
inverse of the previously assumed relationship.]* -> can think of
retrotransposons as "intracellular virus" but not a virus bc lacks protein coat.
The promoter is transcribed with the rest of the genes to allow the inserted
retrotransposon to continue to proliferate.

Class II = **DNA transposons**, do not code for reverse transcriptase; use
transposase enzymes to cut out the DNA from the genome -> enzymes can
bind site specifically or generally, and produce sticky ends. DNA polymerase
fills in the gaps created by the sticky ends and DNA ligase fixes the backbone.
The transposon in question will encode the enzymes required for its own
transposition, but will require cell machinery.

### LINES: L1, "long interspersed nuclear elements"

20% of the genome; 900,000 copies.

Class I i.e. they code for reverse trascriptase and insert themselves into the
genome via an mRNA intermediate. They have a promotor and two separate
open reading frames to code for the **reverse transcriptase, the
endonuclease & the RNase H**. LINES are defined by *"target site
duplication"* sequences on either side of their genetic information. As they
are mRNA integrations into DNA they have a polyA tail at the 3' end.

+ Target site duplication at either end
+ A promoter for transcription
+ ORF1 = Reverse transcriptase to copy the RNA to DNA
+ ORF2 = Endonuclease to cleave the target DNA e.g. RNase H
(ribonuclease H) for RNA removal
+ 5' UTR contains the promotor, 3' UTR has the poly A tail
+ untranslated region = sequences which are transcribed but not
translated
