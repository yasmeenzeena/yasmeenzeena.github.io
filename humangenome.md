## Human Genome

This can be split up into the **nuclear genome** and the **mitochondrial genome.**
Mitochondrial genome is inherited purely from the maternal line and there is no
recombination. Of the 37 genes it encodes 22 are tRNA genes, 13 are for
enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (main role of mitochondria =
OxPhos) and 2 make rRNA. Mitochondrial genomes are small but there are
many mitochondrial per cell, so their genome can account for up to 0.5% of
the cell's DNA!

>nuclear genome = 25,000 genes; mitochondrial genome = 37 genes; 22 tRNA,
2 rRNA, 13 for enzymes in OxPhos.

#### Structure of the Mitochondrial Genome

Circular! Double stranded: one heavy & one light strand. Heavy is G-rich so
has more double ring structures (purines), light is C rich so has more single
ring structures (pyrimidines.)

Neither strand has any overlapping genes! There are also no introns (bacterial
descendant.) No introns => whole strand is transcribed as one unit and then
cleaved into individual mRNAs. No need for multiple promoters but all genes
are expressed together.

Heavy: 28 genes encoded, G rich, purines
Light: 9 genes encoded, C rich, pyrimidine

a tiny section of the mitochondria DNA forms a *"D loop"*, where it actually
is triple stranded DNA. A section of complimentary DNA comes in and replaces
the heavy strand and hydrogen bonds to the light strand for a little while.
Replication of the mitochondrial DNA starts in either direction at the D loop.
Large parts are highly variable and the region has proven to be useful for the
study of the evolutionary history of vertebrates

### Nuclear Genome Structure

Chromosomes are numbered by size (1 is the largest etc.) They have a "p"
strand (petite) and a "q" strand (the longer one.) 23 chromosomes are made
from 22 autosomes (i.e. somatic) and one sex chromosome.

Only 1.5% of the genome codes for human proteins! LINES&SINES take up
anywhere from 30% to almost 50%, and introns another 30%. Thus duplications
and repeats account for most of the genome.

### Gene Regulation
DNA is arranged intron->exon->intron->exon. Before and after the exon (i.e.
the gene) is a flanking region. The 5" flanking region contains the promoter
(binds RNA polymerase) and the enhancer&regulatory sequences if applicable
(binds additional proteins to stabilise RNA polymerase complex.) It is not
transcribed nor translated.
