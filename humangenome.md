## Human Genome

This can be split up into the **nuclear genome** and the **mitochondrial genome.**
Mitochondrial genome is inherited purely from the maternal line and there is no
recombination. Of the 37 genes it encodes 22 are tRNA genes, 13 are for
enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (main role of mitochondria =
OxPhos) and 2 make rRNA. Mitochondrial genomes are small but there are
many mitochondrial per cell, so their genome can account for up to 0.5% of
the cell's DNA!

>nuclear genome = 25,000 genes; mitochondrial genome = 37 genes; 22 tRNA,
2 rRNA, 13 for enzymes in OxPhos.

####Structure of the Mitochondrial Genome

Circular! Double stranded: one heavy & one light strand. Heavy is G-rich so
has more double ring structures (purines), light is C rich so has more single
ring structures (pyrimidines.)

Neither strand has any overlapping genes! There are also no introns (bacterial
descendant.) No introns => whole strand is transcribed as one unit and then
cleaved into individual mRNAs. No need for multiple promoters but all genes
are expressed together.

Heavy: 28 genes encoded, G rich, purines
Light: 9 genes encoded, C rich, pyrimidine
